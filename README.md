# Interview-Bot
The project, made as the part of our final year project, is an application which has capabilities of taking technical interviews both in terms of aptitude and face to face interview. An android application takes resume as the only input from the user, identifies user's skills and asks adaptive questions to user based on those skills. Face to face interviews are taken on windows application on which there is an interviewer who asks questions to the user based on his resume. The interviewer is a 3D model which seems to be like a human being. The conversation between the user and the interviewer happens through voice like a real interview. User's face is captured through the webcam and his/her emotions are detected to identify the level of confidence during the interview. This confidence level is then used to increase or decrease the difficulty of the question.
